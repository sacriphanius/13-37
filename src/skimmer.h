// Card-skimmer detector. Card skimmers (the kind you find slapped under a
// gas-pump fascia or on ATM card readers) are almost universally built
// around cheap HC-series Bluetooth modules so the operator can sit in the
// parking lot and skim track data over a BT serial link. The
// ESP32Marauder project surfaces them by matching the device name —
// "HC-03" / "HC-05" / "HC-06" are the names the bare modules ship with,
// and the people building these skimmers tend not to bother changing them
// (https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/detect-card-skimmers).
//
// We do the same name-prefix match passively via the shared BLE scan
// manager. HC-0x modules are dual-mode (BR/EDR + BLE) on the modern clones,
// so the BLE advertisement carries the same name; pure-Classic-only
// variants aren't visible to this detector. False positives are mostly
// hobby projects that left the default name in place — usually obvious
// from context (drone telemetry, robotics kit, etc.).

// Inspect one BLE advertisement for an HC-0x name. Returns true on a match
// (and dedups against recent hits). Used by both the standalone scanner and
// the wardriver — both call this from the BT task, so the dedup state
// needs no locking.
