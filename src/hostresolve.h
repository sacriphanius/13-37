// Hostname resolver for ping-sweep results. Runs a three-pass discovery
// against the discovered devices, filling in each PingDevice::name +
// name_source field as answers arrive:
//
//   Pass 1 (mDNS)  — multicast PTR query per IP to 224.0.0.251:5353,
//                    listen 1.5 s for `.local` responses.
//   Pass 2 (PTR)   — unicast PTR query per still-unresolved IP to the
//                    LAN's configured DNS server, 8-way parallel via
//                    select().
//   Pass 3 (OUI)   — vendor lookup from the MAC's first three bytes
//                    against a curated consumer-device OUI table. Always
//                    available as a fallback when both DNS passes miss.
//
// Spawned automatically by pingsweep at the end of a sweep — the UI sees
// names trickle into the device rows as each pass writes them.

// Pass identifiers used in HostResolveStats::pass to tell the UI which
// stage the resolver is currently in.
